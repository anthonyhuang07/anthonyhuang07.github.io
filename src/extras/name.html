            <h1>What does <span class="date">FHDHGNGN</span> Mean?</h1>
        </div>
        <article>
            <p>
                FHDHGNGN stands for nothing. When I made the username, I was playing a Terraria (or at the time I
                thought, Minecraft) knockoff mobile game called The Blockheads. I was joining online play for the first
                time and needed a username. You guessed it! I keyboard smashed.<br><br>The result was very different
                from FHDHGNGN, that's because after I deleted the game, I forgot the username (what a surprise) but the
                next time I needed a username, I just tried remembering what my username was for The Blockheads. It came
                out as FHDHGNGN. Ever since late 2016/early 2017, it has been my go-to username until 2018. Here are all
                the username changes I have done.<br><br>

                Also, I lied. FHDHGNGN has some meaning (kinda?? I just made it up like 2 years after I made the
                username) the reason why I switched to FHD later on was not only to simplify it because nobody could
                remember it, but I just looked up a meaning for FHD and it actually meant Full HD, which is 1080p. Very
                fitting at the time because I only made 1080p videos. The rest means nothing.<br><br>
                If you want to memorize the username. You can think of FHDHGNGN standing for "Full High-Definition (HD)
                h GoodNightGoodNight"<br>
                The GNGN doesn't actually mean goodnightgoodnight, but it's a nice way to remember it. You start with
                the name for 1080p (Full HD), then add the middle letter in FHD (h, or simply just remember h because of
                the meme) then add Goodnight Goodnight. And there you have it, FHDHGNGN!<br>
