            <div class="content"><br>
                    <p>This is the first post of the page. I actually have some things to say too! <br><br>
                        Yesterday night was literally hell. It was like 26 degrees outside (felt like 30) and I couldn't sleep. (I had my window open, we didn't have AC on because I think the vents weren't cleaned) Luckily, the weather report said it was going to rain for 40 minutes, and I was so relieved. So I waited, and it was time. Guess what? IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN. I ended up with 6 hours of sleep which is a new low this year.<br><br>
                        Anyways, I went to school, we had an annoying geography test that I definitely failed on, and we started the movies unit in French.<br><br>
                        Break passed, played Geometry Dash, nothing special, and as I'm writing this in Math class, I wanted to get an image from my Saved Images folder. Guess what? NOTHING. LITERALLY NOTHING. EVERYTHING WAS GONE! There wasn't anything in my Recycle Bin either. I'm pretty sure my drive suffered data loss after I installed Linux. RIP<br><br>
                        I didn't really have any important images there, but they were super awesome and cool, and cool looking timelines in Premiere, 1st in Kahoot, donations, all that stuff. But it was all gone, and I am sad.<br><br>
                        However, the good news is that our math test got pushed to Wednesday, and that's fun. Yay??<br><br>
                        Just got my Unit 3 math test back, and I got 100, 86, 86 and 52 (💀) However it wasn't that bad, its overall 81 and my math overall OVERALL mark went from 85 to 86! GGs!!!!<br><br>
                        I am also proud to say that I got collapsibles working on here! This page has been finally uploaded to GitHub Pages.<br><br>
                        Anyways, that's it for today, goodbye! (I'm writing this the next day because i forgor)

                <p>Hey guys, I don't think this day is going to be interesting but I have something I want to show.<br><br>
                    Before that, I started the day biking to school with sore legs, and I arrived a bit late, but it was fine. <br><br>
                    Right now in Geography class, I just finished writing my Wikia article for this fictional universe called the G9DS. It has a big lore surrounding it, about the Grade 9 Discord Server, and I suggest you read up on the articles, but you should definitely check <a href="https://nengipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anthony_Huang">my article</a> first.<br><br>
                    I wasn't expecting anything funny to happen today, but right after we left geo, my friend and some other people were walking in the hallways heading to our next classes, and our geo teacher passed by. My friend loudly said "AU REVOIR MADAME!" literally leaning outwards and yelling, and guess what? She looked at him dead in the eye soulless, ignoring him, saying nothing, and walking past him. IT WAS SO FUNNY LMFAO<br><br>
                    I also died at 93% on Nantendo during break, GG<br><br>
                    Other than that, I started decorating my Geometry Dash level, and I spent 4 hours only decorating about 5%.<br><br>
                    That's all from me for today. GOODBYE!

            <div class="content"><br>
                <p>GOOD MORNIng GOOd evENING everyone I have lots of news that I didn't bother writing yesterday! <br><br>
                    Small stuff: I submitted my geography project, did my math test, and got 12% on Acu (an Extreme Demon!)<br><br>
                    Now the highlight of yesterday: My phone broke. Not what you expect, so I'm just going to rant about this more and tell you a bit of my history with iPhones.<br><br>
                    I have had bad luck with iPhones ever since I got my 2nd iPhone, the iPhone 6, in 2018. Before that, I owned an iPhone 4, which was my grandpa's, and let me say, old iPhones are actually goated. That iPhone 4 had an average of 5 hours battery, and could still run most apps on iOS 7!<br><br>
                    It was getting old though, so my grandma gave me her old phone, the iPhone 6. That was the worst phone I ever owned. Ever since I got it, it had this screen issue, where the entire touchscreen was unresponsive sometimes, and the only way to fix it is to turn off and on again (not like entirely reboot, just go to the lock screen and back home) it was very annoying. Another issue was the battery. It only lasted like 1-2 hours, and it would often restart because it could reach the necessary peak power. This means that the battery was EXTREMELY used, and it was in really bad condition.<br><br>
                    Anyways, being me, my anger couldn't handle it, and I broke the screen. While I continued using it for a while, I eventually switched to my mom's Galaxy S4 Mini for a while. Now the S4 Mini is a goated phone.<br><br>
                    Now if you're wondering "Why can't he just switch to android?!!?!?" well.... my About Me partially explains it, but also, I have an Apple Watch, AirPods Pro, and soon a MacBook, and I pay for iCloud+, so I really can't leave anymore. If I had the chance, I definitely would.<br><br>
                    I don't want to flood this section, so I just gonna briefly explain how I broke my next iPhones. <br><br>
                    iPhone 7 (1) - My mom's, it worked perfectly fine, I even got a dBrand decal for it, but one day I decided to repair an iPhone for the first time, by replacing its degraded battery. What I didn't know at the time, was that iPhones had waterproof seals, and if you open them, they break. I didn't know I had to buy one. So yeah, water damage.<br><br>
                    iPhone 7 (2) - from Amazon Renewed - worked perfectly fine, until the known No Service issue on iPhone 7s occured. Luckily, I got a refund for this one.<br><br>
                    iPhone 8 - from Amazon Renewed - worked perfectly fine, some cosmetic damage, but other than that, the phone is great! One day however, I was taking a slowmotion video of underwater footage, and WATER DAMAGE. Now I wondered "How did this even break??? It has a waterproof seal, right?" I never opened it, so it shouldn't be broken! Well guess what, after the screen got absolutely destroyed by the water, I opened it up. IT WAS SO EASY TO OPEN UP. Now when you open an iPhone with a waterproof seal, it's super hard to open, because it acts like some type of glue. The iPhone 8 opened up so easily, and I think it's because the Amazon Renewed employees didn't bother putting in a waterproof seal. There were so many other missing parts too! I made a full video on my experience with Amazon Renewed, or at least a video portraying the average Amazon Renewed worker. Watch it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t32xYZPREKc">here.</a> I did not get a refund for this as it was 6 months out of refund range, so that's $200 down the drain.<br><br>
                    Ever since then, I've never bought Amazon Renewed ever again. I didn't have a phone for around 4 months, and didn't buy one because I was very poor. I had to use my iPad as a "Phone" throughout that time.<br><br>
                    That brings us to today. My iPhone XS. This one cost $390, off eBay, because I was done with Amazon. This was the best phone I've owned since the iPhone 4, and the only problem was that it restarted randomly, but that was like once a month, and other than that, the phone was in perfect cosmetic condition.<br><br>
                    (My friend Liam wanted to be mentioned, so here you go)<br><br>
                    So recently, I've been dropping my phone a lot. Yesterday, I dropped my phone on very soft concrete, so I thought it was fine. I went home, and at night, it came in contact with water, and the camera got blurry. I got worried and wondered if my phone was actually open, but no. The camera cover split open. Then out of nowhere, it started boot looping. Now I decided to try this method for the first time - putting my phone in rice. Now this morning, it works fine, and I even washed and gorilla glued the camera cover back on. I can tell the quality is slightly degraded, but it's still useable and good quality.<br><br>
                    So that's the rant. I won't be switching to Android any time soon, despite me really wanting to.

            <div class="content"><br>
                <p>good afternoon guys, small news - my iphone camera can't focus close range and long range, and I'm planning to get it repaired. I got 43% on future funk, got the dual part down.<br><br>
                    Today's quote of the day is: OH MY GOD!!! *hyperventilates in disbelief* OH MY GOD YEEEEEEEEEESSSSS!!! YES! YES! YES! YES! *sobbing* Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god i did it! Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god! *intense sobbing* Oh my god, oh my god, i did it! Oh my god, oh my god! *even more intense sobbing*<br><br>
                    most people today are at a field trip in Justin Bieber's hometown to watch a play called Chicago, so classes are mostly empty today.<br><br>
                    Here's the highlight of the day - so today is international ramen day or something, and the school was selling bowl noodles. I got one, but THEY DIDN'T HAVE HOT WATER. The only water I had was cold, so I just dealt with it, until my friend suggested an idea.<br><br>
                    So my other friend wanted me to bring my screwdriver set to school because he wanted to open his MacBook, so having my set, I opened my own computer, and you know what I did? i put the bowl on the huge piece of copper sheet, I think it's responsible for keeping the heat, and then the fan disperses it. I put it on there, opened HOW on Geometry Dash (one of the highest object levels in geometry dash), all my adobe programs, vscode, basically every program that uses a lot of system components. The PC got extremely hot, and it was funny to see if the noodles would heat up.<br><br>
                    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/CFPcHha.jpg" alt="bowl noodles on heatsink" width="400px" style="margin-left: 0;" id="nodole"/><br>
                    The end result: still pretty cold, but it dispersed enough that I could eat it. It was actually pretty good, despite it being cold. 7.175/10.<br><br>
                    Quote of the hour: But you didn't have to cut me off, Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing. And I don't even need your love, but you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough. You didn't have to stoop so low, have your friends collect your records and then change your number. I guess that I don't need that though, now you're just somebody that I used to know, now you're just somebody that I used to know<br><br>
                    Also, since there's a field trip today, and it's on a play, most drama students are gone. By most, only 5 people showed up today in drama class. There were other people in the hallways that didn't come to class, so we just spent most of the class time having a conversation with the teacher as a group.<br><br>
                    Nothing else interesting. Goodbye!

                <p>gonna just do a quick issue, today was nothing interesting, but we had a huge thunderstorm that lasted like half an hour, and apparently 2 people died. It was really bad. The rest of the day was just me trying to do 54-100 on Future Funk, but I got 54-99 :/ Goodbye!

            <div class="content"><br>
                <p>Hey y'all! (scott here) sorry i havent posted in a while, i was never motivated to post until a few days ago, but nothing interesting happened until today.<br><br>
                    It started in drama class, we were doing an equity forum. Basically something the school does to "support" students mental health and all that, talking about how to deal with harmful language or whatever. (It isn't really that helpful)<br><br>
                    So they were talking about how we could make the school a safer place and whatnot, and class was ending. So we decided to all get up and head over to the room where all our stuff is to pack up and get home, until the PA SYSTEM JUST SAID "A LOCKDOWN HAS BEEN ISSUED THIS IS NOT A DRILL" we went into full panic mode, and that's when the story began.<br><br>
                    ~2:30 - we get into the room and everyone stays, doors are locked, lights are out. Everyone is worried, finding new information.<br><br>
                    2:42 - <a href="https://twitter.com/HRPSOak/status/1531707630841896962?cxt=HHwWhICxwbL-28EqAAAA">New information:</a> place is under investigation, everyone is still worried, not much information we have<br><br>
                    ~2:55 - SWAT/Police with flashlight Assault Rifles came into the room, asked for a [REDACTED] (we later find out that's the suspect's name) He is a grade 11 perm boy, we thought he was grade 12. It is surprising to see an 05 as the suspect.<br><br>
                    ~3:19 - Suspect in custody, he had a replica handgun, and it was for drama class 💀 then someone called the police because they thought it was real. GG!<br><br>
                    The entire process was nerve wracking, and it was my first serious school emergency. I have more proofs I want to put here for future usage:<br>

                    <p>In the end, it was a "cool" experience and I finally got to experience a real emergency. Was it real though? In the end, it was a big misunderstanding, and the guy's reputation is now ruined. It's also ironic how that just a few minutes before the lockdown, we were talking about how we would make our school a safer place. Guess what happened next...<br><br>
                    Then I biked home in 32 degree weather and died. The end!</p>
