        description: `Hey! My name is Anthony Huang, also known as anthonyhuang07 or FHDHGNGN online.
        
        <br><br>I'm a 17-year-old high school student from Ontario, Canada, born in Québec and of Chinese descent. 

        <br><br>My Chinese name is 黄嘉言 (Huáng Jiāyán), where 黄 (Huáng), my family name, means "Yellow", and 嘉言 (Jiāyán) means "Good with words". Ironically, I don't consider myself good with words in any language.
        
        <br><br>I have a strong passion for all things tech and computing, as well as linguistics and geography! Ironically, I hate math and literature—despite math being the foundation of computing and literature being an application of linguistics. I also enjoy history, video editing, sports, gaming and adventure.
        
        <br><br>My life goal is to travel the world, visiting as many countries as possible and connecting with locals culturally and linguistically.`,

        description: `Almost everything I know in this field is self-taught. I started programming at 8 years old when I discovered the p5.js course on Khan Academy, and it immediately clicked with me that making cool things on the computer was for me. For a while after, I made many games and animations on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Xboxgolfer/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. By the time I was 10, I had started learning basic web development with HTML and CSS.
        
        <br><br>I made my return to programming at 13, after learning much about the tech world outside of just coding. I learned basic C to get back the vibe, then JavaScript, where I built my first side project—a Discord bot. Web development soon became my primary focus, and I later learned Python and TypeScript.
        
        <br><br>I've participated in 5 hackathons, earning awards in 2 of them. I sometimes dabble in competitive programming, I primarily use Python and took part in the CCC Junior, where I scored 56/75.
        
        <br><br>I am a soon-to-be Computer Science student in university. I hope to gain more full-stack programming experience, and I am currently learning <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/FHDHGNGN" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a>, hoping to become a pentester.`,

        description: `I speak fluent English, B1 French, A2 Mandarin and A1 Japanese.
        
        <br><br>I spent the first 8 years of my life in Québec, where I regularly spoke both English and French. I have been immersed in English media since I was a baby, while also using French outside the house. At home, I spoke both Mandarin and English with my family, as my parents are immigrants from China.
        
        <br><br>At 8, I moved to Ontario, where English became my primary language. Although I continued studying French at school, my fluency gradually declined due to a lack of regular exposure. However, in Grade 12, my passion for the language reignited, and I am now preparing to take the DELF B2 exam.
        
        <br><br>My interest in Japanese began when I was 15, sparked by anime and an upcoming trip to Japan. I currently hold a JLPT N5 certificate, however, I still struggle with speaking as I have nobody to talk to in Japanese. I plan to take the JLPT N3 next, and I actively maintain my skills through daily flashcard reviews, exposure to Japanese content on social media, as well as listening to and singing Japanese music.
        
        <br><br>Studying Japanese has required me to rely on my Chinese knowledge, leading to fascinating connections. Being part of a diverse friend group has also exposed me to different cultures and languages. Even as a child, I had a knack for mimicking pronunciations, which naturally led to my fascination with phonetics. These experiences combined eventually sparked my interest in linguistics. I often pick up words from various languages—Persian, Turkish, Korean—simply out of curiosity, even if I don’t formally study them. My passion for linguistics is also deeply influenced by my passion for history and geography.`,

        <br><br>The game I currently play most is probably Rocket League, where my peak is Diamond II in 2v2.

Due to some unfortunate events, I later stopped watching anime.
        
        <br><br>In 2023, I was friends with people who were in the anime/manga scene, so I decided to give anime another try, watching Oshi no Ko (which just aired) and later Bocchi the Rock. These animes reignited my enjoyment for anime, and kickstarted my Japanese learning journey.
