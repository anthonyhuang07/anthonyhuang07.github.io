        <br><br>I'm a 17-year-old high school student from Ontario, Canada, born in Québec and of Chinese descent. 
        
        <br><br>I have a strong passion for all things tech and computing, as well as linguistics and geography! Ironically, I hate math and literature—despite math being the foundation of computing and literature being an application of linguistics. A few factors are to blame for this, don't ask.
        
        <br><br>My life goal is to travel the world, visiting as many countries as possible and connecting with locals by speaking their native languages.`,

        description: `Almost everything I know in this field is self-taught. I started programming at 8 years old when I discovered the p5.js course on Khan Academy, and it immediately clicked with me that making cool things on the computer was for me. For a while after, I made many games and animations on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Xboxgolfer/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>. By the time I was 10, I had started learning basic web development with HTML and CSS.
        
        <br><br>I made my return to programming at 13, after learning much about the tech world outside of just coding. I learned basic C to get back the vibe, then JavaScript, where I built my first side project—a Discord bot. Web development soon became my primary focus, and I later learned Python and TypeScript.
        
        <br><br>I've participated in 5 hackathons, earning awards in 2 of them. I sometimes dabble in competitive programming, I primarily use Python and took part in the CCC Junior, where I scored 56/75.
        
        <br><br>I am a soon-to-be Computer Science student in university. I hope to gain more full-stack programming experience, and I am currently learning <a href="https://tryhackme.com/p/FHDHGNGN" target="_blank">cybersecurity</a>, hoping to become a pentester.`,

        description: `I speak fluent English, B1 French, A2 Mandarin and A1 Japanese.
        
        <br><br>I spent the first 8 years of my life in Québec, where I regularly spoke both English and French. I have been immersed in English media since I was a baby, while also using French outside the house. At home, I spoke both Mandarin and English with my family, as my parents are immigrants from China.
        
        <br><br>At 8, I moved to Ontario, where English became my primary language. Although I continued studying French at school, my fluency gradually declined due to a lack of regular exposure. However, in Grade 12, my passion for the language reignited, and I am now preparing to take the DELF B2 exam.
        
        <br><br>My interest in Japanese began when I was 15, sparked by anime and an upcoming trip to Japan. I currently hold a JLPT N5 certificate, however, I still struggle with speaking as I have nobody to talk to in Japanese. I plan to take the JLPT N3 next, and I actively maintain my skills through daily flashcard reviews, exposure to Japanese content on social media, as well as listening to and singing Japanese music.
        
        <br><br>Studying Japanese has required me to rely on my Chinese knowledge, leading to fascinating connections. Being part of a diverse friend group has also exposed me to different cultures and languages. Even as a child, I had a knack for mimicking pronunciations, which naturally led to my fascination with phonetics. These experiences combined eventually sparked my interest in linguistics. I often pick up words from various languages—Persian, Turkish, Korean—simply out of curiosity, even if I don’t formally study them. My passion for linguistics is also deeply influenced by my passion for history and geography.`,

        <br><br>The game I currently play most is probably Rocket League, where my peak is Diamond II in 2v2.

        <br><br>I also play a lot of Geotastic (a crowdsourced version of GeoGuessr) due to my love for geography.
        
        <br><br>The game I have the most playtime on is Geometry Dash, with over 1000 hours on Steam, and 63 demons completed. My hardest is Future Funk (Hard Demon) and I had a 72% best on Acu (Extreme Demon).

        <br><br>I follow what happens in the world of football daily. I don't support any Premier League club, but I guess I can consider myself a Bayern München supporter, though my support for them is nowhere near my support for CF Montréal.
        
        <br><br>In real life, I played house league at my local soccer club on and off, and I can play any position on either wing. I can even play as backup goalkeeper because I have very strong reaction time and reflexes.`,

Then in 2020, I watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which became my favorite and the primary focus of my YouTube channel back then (I was a Roblox JoJo YouTuber). Unfortunately, due to some cyberbullying in that community (I was 12 at the time) I told myself I would never watch anime again.
        
        <br><br>In 2023, I was friends with people who were in the anime/manga scene, so I decided to give anime another try, watching Oshi no Ko (which just aired) and later Bocchi the Rock. These animes sparked my interest in learning Japanese.
