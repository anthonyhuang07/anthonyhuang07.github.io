                FHDHGNGN has no meaning. When I made the username, I was playing a mobile game called The Blockheads, where I needed a username. I ended up keyboard smashing. FHDHGNGN is actually the simplified result of that username after I forgot the original keyboard smashed username. The following is a history of all my usernames up to now:

                <br><br>• 2015-2016: xboxgolfer
                <br>• 2016-2018: FHDHGNGNgaming

                <br><br>Nowadays though, the FHD in FHDHGNGN kinda means 'Full HD' as in 1080p.
